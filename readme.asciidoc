== MongoDB Metrics Storage Engine ==

This project provides a storage engine based on MongoDB for timeseries event data stream. Metrics (min, max, avg, sum) are calculated periodically and stored separately from the event data stream.

=== Requirements: ===
* Apache Maven version 3
* Spring Data MongoDB 1.4.0.M1
* MongoDB 2.0.7 or later

=== Building: ===

To build, issue this from the command line:
[source]
----
mvn clean install

=== How it works: ===

==== Gauge Event ====

Event data stream is represented as +GaugeEvent+. Event can be represented in the form of following JSON structure. Gauge event has a +value+ field stored as +double+ and optionally context data can be stored in the form of map construct. Events are stored in their separate collections.
e.g. for event with name 'request'; a collection with name +request.event+ is created in the +eventstore+ database.

Events can be stored using the REST interface.

[source, js]
----
curl -i -X PUT http://localhost:8080/rest/event/ -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d 
'{"occuredOn":"2013-12-28T14:19:56Z","eventType":"request","value":11.0,"contextData":{"hostname":"localhost"}}'
----

JSON Structure of stored Gauge Event:

[source, js]
----
{
    "_id" : ObjectId("52bede0cc2e6f68c4ad8b7a6"),
    "_class" : "net.arunoday.metric.store.model.GaugeEvent",
    "occuredOn" : ISODate("2013-12-28T14:19:56Z"),
    "eventType" : "request",
    "value" : 11,
    "contextData" : {
        "hostname" : "localhost"
    }
}
----

==== Gauge Metric ====

Metrics (+min+, +max+, +mean+, +sum+) are calculated based on the event input. Metrics are calculated using hierarchial aggregations. 

Following aggregations are supported:

* Minute-wise
* Hourly
* Daily
* Monthly
* Yearly

For each event type; aggregation results are stored in separate collections in +metricstore+ database. e.g. +request.minute+ +request.hourly+ +request.daily+ +request.monthly+ and +request.yearly+
For generating minute wise aggregations, event data is used. But for hourly aggregations, instead of using event data stream; minute wise aggregations are used. Same approach is used for further aggregations of higher granularity.

        "count" : 12,
        "min" : 0,
        "max" : 603,
        "mean" : 597.5,
